# Purpose #
Grammar Builder tailored towards setting up a Simple Expression Parser
# Goals #
The goals are to take advantage of latest developments in Java, including Regular Expressions and Lambda Expressions. The focus is to remain on _coding_ the grammar using Java, providing a tight linkage with your custom expression model.
# History #
This project is a spawn-off from [the jmep project](http://code.google.com/p/jmep). The jmep project uses a parser that was borrowed from the ideas of [the Dijkstra shunting-yard algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm). This has been always a nice way of implementing for C-style languages. However, parsing is very static, and cryptic to modify the language elements. It makes it nearly impossible to make a configurable parser, where the user can add in easily his own language elements.
# Status #
It is just started, and the start was simple: writing a Main class that exemplifies how I intend to use the API. Then, using netbeans, it is just a matter of implementing all what's red and missing implementation. Amazing how fast that can go.
As of current - I do not have runnable code - but at the pace it is going, I expect it not to take too long! Keep following!

Cheers!
